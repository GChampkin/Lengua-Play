                <h2>A note from the author</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="author">
                <p>Hi! My name's Gregory Champkin and I am a secondary languages teacher specialising in Spanish and
                    French education in London, United Kingdom. I have been a teach for 4 years and have extensive
                    experience in helping the younger generations to "get" languages. I know first-hand how bumpy the
                    journey can be to understanding a new language and so, as a lover of fun games, I created this
                    website to provide a more enjoyable way for learners to wrap their heads around some of the trickier
                    concepts in the Spanish language.</p>
                <p>Learning languages wasn't easy for me either and I did not learn them the conventional way. As an
                    ex-performer, I moved to Paris, France in 2016 on a performance job. There I realised how necessary
                    it was for me to communicate in other languages. I got a private coach in both French and Spanish
                    and started my journey from there.</p>
                <p>It wasn't easy but I can tell you one thing for free, it's your commitment and "can-do" attitude that
                    will make all the difference! It took me 2 years from A to B to become fluent. By 2019, thanks to
                    nothing other than my determination I managed to get on a university course to achieve a PGCE in
                    Secondary Languages education. </p>
                <p>I made languages a part of my life, and so can you! So keep learning, be inquistive, and never give
                    up. Oh, and always remember to have fun with it!</p>
