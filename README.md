# LENGUA PLAY - An interactive Spanish learning website

The premise for this site is to create a fun and friendly environment for English-speaking learners of Spanish to engage with learning content and apply their knowledge in related interactive games that test their understanding. 
This website will be particularly useful for young learners currently in the education system due to its overall aesthetic and content taken from the British National Curriculum system. However, it is intended for use by all learners irrespective of age.

### Features left to implement

* This project has been created with the intent of expanding it for further use in the future.
* The "Play Zone" has been designed to be a landing platform for a bank of various interactive games for the user to choose the most relevant game to their needs.
* Moving forwards I will be ensuring to create more games that can be added to the site.

## Testing


## Validator testing

### HTML
* When run through the official W3C Validator, an error is thrown in relation to the presence of the background element being used within the <body> tag. However after extensive research I found that doing it this way was the only way to be able to insert my own image saved on my device as a background image behind all elements. I will need to conduct further research in order to work out how to use my own image that does not have a link as a background. 

### CSS


### JavaScript


### Accessibility


### Unfixed bugs
